* CRAN test NOTE: Uses the superseded package: 'doSNOW'. 

  Comment: We use the 'doSNOW' package because we want to print computation progress via the 'progress' package in a parallelized for-loop and there seems to be no convenient alternative at the moment.
  
* CRAN test NOTE: installed size is 7.2Mb

  Comment: We have included data and models within the package for demonstration purposes. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and kindly request your understanding and acceptance of the increased package size.
