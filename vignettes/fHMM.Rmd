Welcome to fHMM, a package for modeling financial time series with hidden Markov models. This introductory vignette [motivates the approach](#motivation), gives an [overview](#package-and-vignettes-overview) of the package functionality and the vignettes, informs about [debugging](#debugging) options, and [places the approach in the existing literature](#placement-in-the-literature).

## Motivation

Earning money with stock trading is simple: one only needs to buy and sell stocks at the right moment. In general, stock traders seek to invest at the beginning of upward trends (hereon termed as bullish markets) and repel their stocks just in time before the prices fall again (hereon termed as bearish markets). As stock prices depend on a variety of environmental factors [@hum09; @coh13], chance certainly plays a fundamental role in hitting those exact moments. However, investigating market behavior can lead to a better understanding of how trends alternate and thereby increases the chance of making profitable investment decisions. 

The fHMM package aims at contributing to those investigations by applying hidden Markov models to detect bearish and bullish markets in financial time series. It also implemented the hierarchical extension presented in [@oel21], which improves the model's capability for distinguishing between short- and long-term trends and allows to interpret market dynamics at multiple time scales.

## Package and vignettes overview

The functionality of the fHMM package can be classified into functions for data preparation, model estimation, and model evaluation. The flowchart below visualizes their dependencies.

The tasks *data preparation*, *model estimation*, and *model evaluation* as well as their corresponding functions and classes are explained in detail in separate vignettes:

- The vignette [*Model definition*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v01_model_definition.html) defines the hidden Markov model and its hierarchical extension.

- The vignette [*Controls*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v02_controls.html) introduces the `set_controls()` function which is used for model and estimation specifications. It creates an `fHMM_controls` object that can be fed into the `prepare_data()` function in the next step.

- The vignette [*Data management*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v03_data_management.html) explains how to prepare or simulate data in fHMM. The goal for the data preparation task in the fHMM package is to create an `fHMM_data` object via the `prepare_data()` function that can be fed into the estimation routine in the next step. Furthermore, the function `download_data()` is introduced that can download financial data directly from https://finance.yahoo.com.

- The vignette [*Model estimation*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v04_model_estimation.html) defines the likelihood function and explain the task of its numerical maximization. Subsequently, the `fit_model()` function is introduced that receives an `fHMM_data`, fits an hidden Markov model (specified by `fHMM_controls`) and return an `fHMM_model` object, for which the package provides a `plot`, `print` and `summary` method. 

- The vignette [*State decoding*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v05_state_decoding.html) defines the Viterbi algorithm that is used for decoding the most likely underlying state sequence. It furthermore introduces its implementation in fHMM via the `decode_state()` function. The `reorder_states()` function can be used for state relabeling after the decoding.

- The vignette [*Model checking*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v06_model_checking.html) explains the task of checking a fitted model via computing (pseudo-) residuals, which is implemented via the `compute_residuals()` function.

- The vignette [*Model selection*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v07_model_selection.html) discusses the task of selecting the (in some sense) best model among a set of competing models. The fHMM package provides a convenient `compare_models()` function that receives an arbitrary number of `fHMM_model`-objects and returns comparison statistics.

- The vignette [*Prediction*](http://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/v08_prediction.html) discusses how the package can be used for market forecasting via the `predict()` function.

## Debugging

It was our aim to provide meaningful warning and error messages when something unexpected happens. However, we found that some situations require a more detailed feedback. Therefore, the package includes the `solve_trouble()` function which can be fed by thrown error codes and returns debugging suggestions. 

For any issues that are not covered by this course of action, please [open an issue on the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/loelschlaeger/fHMM/issues).

## Placement in the literature

Over the last decades, various HMM-type models have emerged as popular tools for modeling financial time series that are subject to state-switching over time [@sch97] [@dia09] [@ang12] [@dea17]. [@ryd98], [@bul06], and [@nys15a], e.g., used HMMs to derive stylized facts of stock returns, while [@has05] and [@nys17] demonstrated that HMMs can prove useful for economic forecasting. More recently, [@lih17] applied HMMs to the Standard and Poor's 500 (S\&P 500), where HMMs were used to identify different levels of market volatility, aiming at providing evidence for the conjecture that returns exhibit negative correlation with volatility. Another application to the S\&P 500 can be found in [@ngu18], where HMMs were used to predict monthly closing prices to derive an optimal trading strategy, which was shown to outperform the conventional buy-and-hold strategy. Further applications, which involve HMM-type models for asset allocation and portfolio optimization, can be found in [@ang02], [@bul11], and [@nys15a] [@nys18], to name but a few examples. All these applications demonstrate that HMMs constitute a versatile class of time series models that naturally accounts for the dynamics typically exhibited by financial time series.
