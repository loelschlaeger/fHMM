Specifying a model in fHMM is simple. You only need to define the named list `controls` and pass it to `fit_hmm`, i.e.

1. define `controls = list(<parameters>)` and

2. call `fit_hmm(controls)` for estimation.

The list `controls` can contain the following parameters. You can either specify none, all, or selected parameters. Unspecified parameters are set to default values.

## `id`

A character, which identifies a model. The default is `id = "test"`. We recommend to set a meaningful identification, e.g. `id = "dax_hmm_2_states"`.

## `path`

A character, setting the path where model results get saved. The default is `path = tempdir()`, which is the path of the per-session temporary directory. We recommend to set a path to your current working directory, e.g. `path = "."`.

## `model`

This control determines the type model that you want to estimate and can be one of

   - `hmm` (to estimate a hidden Markov model),
   
   - `hhmm` (to estimate a hierarchical hidden Markov model).
   
The default is `model = hmm`.

## `states`

This control determines the number of states and depends on the control `model`.

   - If `model = hmm`, `states` is an integer. If `states = x`, a hidden Marko model with `x` states is estimated.
   
   - If `model = hhmm`, `states` is a numeric vector of length two. If `states = c(x,y)`, a hierarchical hidden Markov model with `x` coarse-scale and `y` fine-scale states is estimated.
   
The default is `states = 2`, which defines a 2-state hidden Markov model.
   
## `sdds`

This control determines the state-depenent distributions and depends on the control `model`.

   - If `model = hmm`, `states` is one of the following values.
   
   - If `model = hhmm`, `states` is a vector of length two, containing the following values. The first entry defines the state-depenent distribution for the coarse scale, the second entry for the fine scale, respectively.
   
The following state-depenent distributions can be defined:

   - `"t"`, the t-distribution,
   
   - `"t(x)"`, the t-distribution with `x` fixed degrees of freedom (`x = Inf` yields the normal distribution),
   
   - `"gamma"`, the gamma distribution.
   
For example, `sdds = c("t","t(1)")` defines the t-distribution for the coarse scale (degrees of freedom get estimated) and the t-distribution with one degree of freedom for the fine scale.

The default is `sdds = "t"`, which defines state-dependent t-distributions.
   
## `horizon`

This control determines the length of the time horizon.
   
- `horizon`: A vector of length 2, determining the length of the time horizion(s). The first entry is numeric and mandatory if data is simulated. The second entry is mandatory if the model is a HHMM and can be either numeric or one of

   - `"w"` for weekly fine-scale chunks,
   
   - `"m"` for monthly fine-scale chunks,
   
   - `"q"` for quarterly fine-scale chunks,
   
   - `"y"` for yearly fine-scale chunks.

The following parameters are optional and set to [default values](#default-values) if you do not specify them:

## `data`

- `data`: A list, containing

   - `soure`: A character vector of length 2, containing the file names of the empirical data:
   
      - If `source = c(NA,NA)`, data is simulated.
      
      - If `source = c("x",NA)`, data "x.csv" in folder "`path`/data" is modeled by a HMM.
      
      - If `source = c("x","y")`, data "x.csv" (type determined by `cs_type`) on the coarse scale and data "y.csv" in folder "`path`/data" on the fine scale is modeled by a HHMM.
      
   - `col`: A character vector of length 2, containing the names of the desired column of `source` for both scales.
   
   - `truncate`: A vector of length 2, containing lower and upper date limits (each in format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`) to select a subset of the empirical data (neither, one or both limits can be specified).
   
   - `cs_type`: A character, determining the type of empirical coarse-scale data in HHMMs, one of
   
      - `"mean"`: means of the fine-scale data,
      
      - `"mean_abs"`: means of the fine-scale data in absolute value,
      
      - `"sum_abs"`: sums of fine-scale data in absolute value.

- `fit`: A list, containing
   
   - `runs`: A numeric value, setting the number of optimization runs.
   
   - `at_true`: A boolean, determining whether the optimization is initialised at the true parameter values. Only for simulated data, sets `runs = 1` and `accept = "all"`.
   
   - `seed`: A numeric value, setting a seed for the simulation and the optimization.
   
   - `accept`: Either a numeric vector (containing acceptable exit codes of the [nlm optimization](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html)) or the character `"all"` (accepting all codes).
   
   - `print.level`: Passed on to [nlm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html).
   
   - `gradtol`: Passed on to [nlm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html).
   
   - `stepmax`: Passed on to [nlm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html).
   
   - `steptol`: Passed on to [nlm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html).
   
   - `iterlim`: Passed on to [nlm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html).
   
   - `scale_par`: A positive numeric vector of length two, scaling the model parameters in a simulation on the coarse and fine scale, respectively.

- `results`: A list, containing
   - `overwrite`: A boolean, determining whether overwriting of existing results (on the same `id`) is allowed. Set to `TRUE` if `id = "test"`.
   
   - `ci_level`: A numeric value between 0 and 1, setting the confidence interval level.
