You already decided on a financial stock you want to model? Download daily prices of your preferred stock from https://finance.yahoo.com/ via
```r 
download_data(name,symbol,from,to,path)
```
where

- `name` is your personal identifier for the stock,

- `symbol` is the stock's symbol,

- `from` and `to` define the time interval (in format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`),

- `path` is the path where the data gets saved.

Historical events can be highlighted in the visualization of the decoded, empirical time series by passing a named list `events` with elements `dates` (a vector of dates) and `names` (a vector of names for the events) to `fit_hmm`, see below for [examples](#examples).

You want to work with simulated data instead? If you do not specify the `source` parameter in the model's `controls`, data gets simulated for you. Specify the model coefficients by passing the list `sim_par` in [thetaList](#parameter-structures) format to `fit_hmm`. Otherwise, the parameters are randomly drawn from -1 to 1. Setting `scale_par(x,y)` in `controls` scales these values by `x` and `y` on the coarse scale and on the fine scale, respectively.
