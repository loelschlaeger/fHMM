The goal of fHMM is to detect bearish and bullish markets in financial time series aplying (hierarchical) hidden Markov models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of fHMM from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fHMM")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("loelschlaeger/fHMM")
```

## Example: Fitting an HMM to the DAX

```{r load}
library(fHMM)
library(magrittr)
```

We fit a 3-state HMM with state-dependent t-distributions to the DAX log-returns from 2010 to 2020. 

The package has a build-in function to download the data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/):

```{r data download}
download_data(symbol = "^GDAXI", file = "dax.csv", verbose = FALSE)
```

We first need to define the model by setting the `controls`:

```{r controls}
controls = list(
  states = 3,
  sdds   = "t",
  data   = list(file        = "dax.csv",
                date_column = "Date",
                data_column = "Close",
                logreturns  = TRUE,
                from        = "2010-01-01",
                to          = "2020-12-31")
)
(controls %<>% set_controls)
```

The function `prepare_data` prepares the data for estimation:

```{r data}
data = prepare_data(controls)
summary(data)
```

We now fit the model and subsequentially decode the hidden states:

```{r fit}
model = fit_model(data, ncluster = 7) %>% decode_states 
summary(model)
```

Let's visualize the estimated state-dependent distributions and the decoded time series:

```{r plots}
model %>% plot("sdds")
model %>% plot("ts")
```
