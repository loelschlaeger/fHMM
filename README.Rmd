The `{fHMM}` R package allows for the detection and characterization of financial market regimes in time series data by applying hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The [vignettes](https://loelschlaeger.de/fHMM/articles/) outline the package functionality and the model formulation. 

For a reference on the method, see:

> Oelschläger, L., and Adam, T. 2021. "Detecting Bearish and Bullish Markets in Financial Time Series Using Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models." Statistical Modelling. https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X211034048

A user guide is provided by the accompanying software paper: 

> Oelschläger, L., Adam, T., and Michels, R. 2024. "fHMM: Hidden Markov Models for Financial Time Series in R". Journal of Statistical Software. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v109.i09

Below, we illustrate an application to the German stock index [DAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX). We also show how to use the package to simulate HMM data, compute the model likelihood, and decode the hidden states using the Viterbi algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the released package version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("fHMM")
```

## Contributing

We are open to contributions and would appreciate your input:

## Example: Fitting an HMM to the DAX

We fit a 3-state HMM with state-dependent t-distributions to the DAX log-returns from 2000 to 2022. The states can be interpreted as proxies for bearish (green below) and bullish markets (red) and an "in-between" market state (yellow).

```{r}
library("fHMM")
```

The package has a build-in function to download financial data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/):

```{r data download, eval = FALSE}
dax <- download_data(symbol = "^GDAXI")
```

We first need to define the model:

```{r controls, eval = FALSE}
controls <- set_controls(
  states      = 3,
  sdds        = "t",
  file        = dax,
  date_column = "Date",
  data_column = "Close",
  logreturns  = TRUE,
  from        = "2000-01-01",
  to          = "2022-12-31"
)
```

The function `prepare_data()` then prepares the data for estimation:

```{r data, eval = FALSE}
data <- prepare_data(controls)
```

The `summary()` method gives an overview:

```{r summary_data}
summary(data)
```

We fit the model and subsequently decode the hidden states and compute (pseudo-) residuals:

```{r fit, eval = FALSE}
model <- fit_model(data)
model <- decode_states(model)
model <- compute_residuals(model)
```

The `summary()` method gives an overview of the model fit:

```{r summary_model}
summary(model)
```

Having estimated the model, we can visualize the state-dependent distributions and the decoded time series:

```{r plot_model_fit, fig.dim = c(10,6)}
events <- fHMM_events(
  list(dates = c("2001-09-11", "2008-09-15", "2020-01-27"),
       labels = c("9/11 terrorist attack", "Bankruptcy Lehman Brothers", "First COVID-19 case Germany"))
)
plot(model, plot_type = c("sdds","ts"), events = events)
```

The (pseudo-) residuals help to evaluate the model fit:

```{r plot_model_residuals, fig.dim = c(10,6)}
plot(model, plot_type = "pr")
```

## Simulating HMM data

The `{fHMM}` package supports data simulation from an HMM and access to the model likelihood function for model fitting and the Viterbi algorithm for state decoding.

1. As an example, we consider a 2-state HMM with state-dependent Gamma distributions and a time horizon of 1000 data points.

```{r, define controls}
controls <- set_controls(
  states  = 2,
  sdds    = "gamma",
  horizon = 1000
)
```

2. Define the model parameters via the `fHMM_parameters()` function (unspecified parameters would be set at random).

```{r, define model parameters}
par <- fHMM_parameters(
  controls = controls,
  Gamma    = matrix(c(0.95, 0.05, 0.05, 0.95), 2, 2), 
  mu       = c(1, 3), 
  sigma    = c(1, 3)
)
```

3. Simulate data points from this model via the `simulate_hmm()` function.

```{r, simulate-hmm-data, fig.dim = c(10,6)}
sim <- simulate_hmm(
  controls        = controls,
  true_parameters = par
)
plot(sim$data, col = sim$markov_chain, type = "b")
```

4. The log-likelihood function `ll_hmm()` is evaluated at the identified and unconstrained parameter values, they can be derived via the `par2parUncon()` function.

```{r, unconstrained and identified parameters}
(parUncon <- par2parUncon(par, controls))
```

Note that this transformation takes care of the restrictions, that `Gamma` must be a transition probability matrix (which we can ensure via the logit link) and that `mu` and `sigma` must be positive (an assumption for the Gamma distribution, which we can ensure via the exponential link).

```{r, evaluate likelihood}
ll_hmm(parUncon, sim$data, controls)
ll_hmm(parUncon, sim$data, controls, negative = TRUE)
```

5. For maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters, we can numerically optimize `ll_hmm()` over `parUncon` (or rather minimize the negative log-likelihood).

```{r, maximize likelihood}
optimization <- nlm(
  f = ll_hmm, p = parUncon, observations = sim$data, controls = controls, negative = TRUE
)

(estimate <- optimization$estimate)
```

6. To interpret the estimate, it needs to be back transformed to the constrained parameter space via the `parUncon2par()` function. The state-labeling is not identified.

```{r, backtransform parameters}
class(estimate) <- "parUncon"
estimate <- parUncon2par(estimate, controls)

par$Gamma
estimate$Gamma

par$mu
estimate$mu

par$sigma
estimate$sigma
```
